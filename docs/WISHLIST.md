These are long-term goals and experimental ideas for SpectraScope:

1.  **Hardware Integration**:
    *   Connect via WebUSB to standard spectrometers (e.g., Ocean Optics) to read live data directly into the browser chart.

2.  **Exoplanet Database**:
    *   Direct integration with the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) to visualize transit spectroscopy data.

3.  **VR Mode**:
    *   Use WebXR to allow users to "step inside" the molecule viewer and see the vibrational modes in Virtual Reality.

4.  **Synthesis Prediction**:
    *   Use Gemini to predict the expected IR spectrum of a drawn molecule before synthesizing it.

5.  **Multi-Language Support**:
    *   Translate the UI and AI analysis into multiple languages to aid international students.
